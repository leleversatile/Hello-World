          <p>What is more important?</p>
          <p>Rushing to complete as many cards as possible or</p>
          <p>Making sure you fully understand the work and why?</p>

        <div>
            <P>I would say making sure that one fully understands the work is the more rational answer.</P>
            <p>Rushing to complete as many cards as possible without understanding the work defeats the purpose of this bootcamp</p>
            <p>If you do not understand the work then it will be hard to complete tasks</p>
